Final project for Bachelor's degree. Using 3 Thymio robots I made characters: ghosts and Pac-man. In a map made out of hard cardboard and black tape
that robots follow, ghost are moving randomly, while Pac-man is controlled by a remote that uses RC5 protocol.
In this repository, you can find code and the documentation of this project, written in Croatian langage.
